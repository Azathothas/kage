//! The visual parity rig: kittest snapshot baselines of the REAL shell
//! at the SPIKE viewport, plus the dominant-color histograms against the
//! palette.
//!
//! The snapshots are the reference the later view epics re-baseline
//! against; the histograms are what a human eyeball used to be for
//! "does the shell still draw the palette". Both themes are checked,
//! because a light palette drift is invisible in the dark one.
//!
//! The rig drives the shipped [`ShellApp`] through `eframe::App::ui`
//! over the replay transport, so a baseline is the real window: the
//! gate banner, the sidebar, the transcript, the composer, the status
//! bar and whichever panel is open. An earlier rig handed
//! `ui::shell::show` three placeholder labels, which meant a baseline
//! could stay green while the app was broken.
//!
//! Two harness facts shape the code below. egui binds a font on the
//! frame after it is installed, so the first frame installs the theme
//! and draws nothing. And the pump thread behind the replay transport
//! asks for a repaint on every event, so the harness is stepped rather
//! than run: `run` stops after four steps and fails, which a window
//! that repaints forever can never satisfy.

///   land inside one lull and render identically while the recording is
///   still half played, which is exactly how the rig flaked between the
///   welcome column, the filled transcript and the frame after it.
/// - The frame has held still for a whole character interval. Once the
///   store stops changing, the reveal keeps typing the assistant text
///   out for up to 2.5 s and the gate banner appears, so the frame
///   reaches its resting image only after the reveal is done.
