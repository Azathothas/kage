//! What this build of kage calls itself.
//!
//! A build names the commit it was made from when it knows it, and a
//! nightly names itself instead of a release number: `0.3.1`,
//! `0.3.1 (abc1234)` or `nightly (abc1234)`. The binaries stamp the
//! string at compile time and hand it over with [`set_version`] first
//! thing, so the libraries report the same one over the protocols
//! without rebuilding on every commit.
