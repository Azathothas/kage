//! The harness the headless probes share: a themed egui context and
//! the one-frame install every probe needs before its widgets draw.
//!
//! The old desktop suite got this from `cx.add_window_view` plus
//! `VisualTestContext`, which installed the fonts and the theme for
//! the window and let a test drive widgets by label. The egui harness
//! replaces that with one helper: [`theme_installed`] installs the
//! fonts, the icons and the shadow theme on the first frame and
//! reports whether the caller should still draw.
//!
//! Every probe reaches this through `mod testutil;`, so the helpers
//! stay out of the shipped crate.

// Each probe uses some of these, not all: one a given probe never
// calls is dead in that binary only.
