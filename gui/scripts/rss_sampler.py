"""Sample a process's resident memory while it runs, and report it.

NFR-02 asks for idle RSS with a 5,000-row transcript: the number must
be flat, not just small, because a transcript that grows its memory
every frame fails the budget no matter where it starts. This script
reads `/proc/<pid>/status` VmRSS on an interval (the same method the
E00 spike used) and prints the series summary: the peak, the first and
last reading, and the growth across the run.

Usage:
    ./gui/scripts/rss_sampler.py -- ./target/debug/kage-desktop --smoke 10000

The child runs to completion; the sampler samples until it exits, then
prints:

    rss: n=100 over 10.0s  settled=90  median=27.4 MB  peak=27.5 MB  tail drift=+0.2 MB  warmup peak=19.8 MB

`tail drift` is the last settled reading minus the first, which is the
number that says whether the process holds steady once it is warm; a
large positive value is a leak and a near-zero one is flat. The first
second is skipped as warmup (the font stack and the replay load there),
which is why the raw first-to-last growth of a short run reads as a
leak that is not there.
Linux only: the source is /proc.
